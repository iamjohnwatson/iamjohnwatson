# Hello, I'm Akash👋

## About Me

I am a tech reporter for Reuters News, passionate about covering the latest developments in the world of technology. My curiosity and interest in data analytics have led me to explore languages like R, Python, and SQL, enhancing my skills to analyze and interpret data trends and build visualizations. I love maps and cartography in general. Making map-based visuals is a favorite pastime! I have previously only used Flourish and Datawrapper, but I am now more proficient in Leaflet than ever and I am learning d3.js and QGIS too.

You will find that my repos have a bit of everything as I try to learn and demonstrate my skills. I also have made a web game using Phaser called Treasure Collector. Go check it out!

## 📰 Tech Reporting

As a tech reporter at Reuters, I cover breaking news around tech companies including electric vehicle makers Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid among others. I use graphical visualizations to enhance storytelling.

## 🌱 Learning Journey

My journey into the world of data analytics and visualization is an ongoing adventure. I believe in the power of data to tell compelling stories, and I'm excited to combine my reporting skills with data-driven insights.
